# Wallet Credit Score Analysis (ML-Based)

This analysis explains the scoring results and wallet behavior based on predicted credit scores generated by a Decision Tree ML model.


# Score Distribution

The score ranges are divided into buckets (each of 100 points):

- 0–100
  Very high-risk wallets. 

- 100–200
  Risky wallets with very few actions.

- 200–300
  Limited usage wallets.

- 300–400
  Average wallets.

- 400–500
  Moderate usage.

- 500–600
  Consistent users with healthy activity.

- 600–700
  Reliable wallets. Regular activity.

- 700–800
  Very active and responsible users.

- 800–900
  Excellent wallets.

- 900–1000
  Perfect behavior. High activity.

# Conclusion

- Our machine learning model did a great job figuring out how people's behavior relates to their credit risk.
- Most of the wallets fall somewhere in the middle, scoring between 300 and 800, which shows they're moderately active.
- When you see scores that are really low or really high, it usually means the activity is either very automated or perfectly normal, like an ideal user.
